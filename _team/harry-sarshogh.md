## HelloOoOoO You 

I am Harry and welcome to my profile.
> I am author and owner of the "Tech Principal Pathways" website.
>> Formerly named "Tech Prinicpal Deep Dive".

I would like to draw your attention to a little story below where you will find why this website gives you best insights about Software Technology Principal Role.


### Not too long, just read it ;)

I have always wanted to be an insightful professional in my career! 
Being like someone knowledgable and trustable who gives you right direction, right answers and build up your confidence when he talks! 

Hang on! or who can reduce uncertainty about a thing when you ask!

> Oh, boy I love that!

To get there, curiosity and passion have been driving me to learn, practice and go further in my journey.
Every day at least one cell learning, one cell growing rather than one step!
Which I personally would called it,  "Knowledge Cells Growing Technique"! (KCGT)!

> Waa Wha What!?! What is that? KCGT?

I am a visual person! and the way I see my brain growth, is like a stack of excel spreadsheets on top of each other, like indefinite cube or multidimensional matrix! and when a cell is filled with something is filed that with knowledge!

Everyone's brain has those multidimensional excel sheets but how much of those cells are filled is important matter!
That's why I would like to say, every day one cell growing! 
> Later on, I will bring up another article about spectrum of each cell! let's move forward for now. 

I work at Thoughtworks in London, UK. 
In 2020, I was lucky to work with several principal consultants at Thoughtworks. I was surprised how strong they were! Great in any aspect! They are excellent in understanding things, discussing, advising, navigating through ambiguties, negotiating, managements, designing, out of box thinking, system thinking, technical architecting, management, coaching, mentoring....

> I wanted to be like them!

I was asking from my self, How they managed to be this! So many people have years of work experience but they are not same as those Tech prinicples! Where these people learn that much abilities and capabilities?


These questions drove me crazy for a year!

I did a lot of search and study during 2020 and 2021 aroud all the aspect of IT and software world! 
- What is the road map!? 
- Where to start!? 
- What to learn!?
- What should I do to get to those levels!?

This was a biggest Jigsaw puzzle in my life!

Lastly! 

I found NO SOLID ANSWER! :< 
NO CLEAR ROAD MAP!

> Damn it!

But what came to my brain was, why there is no solid/categorsised reference over internet for this?

Because it's so hard! and loads of aspects to cover!
Because in software world, there are a lot to understand, learn, study and practice. 
Every adventure journey or even solving a problem has loads of trial and errors! You need to figure out so many pieces and put them to gatehr to achive a solution! and frankly it's not easy!


## Finally! 
----

I got an idea! let's gather every topic I know and I don't know! Any topic involved in Tech Principal Role, then catergorized them and then we go deep dive based on their level of criticallity!

> It went well! Hurraaaay 


That's why I made this website! I want to share that with you! a decent result of good work!

You know what! if I ask you:

 1. What are the basics and fundations you need to learn as part of this job?
 2. What abilities/capabilities/skills you need to have?
 3. What are the scopes and areas your knwoledge you need to demonstrate?
 4. What tools and framework you need to know?
 5. What techniques you must be master?


> I think you got the idea! right ? Yes! well done
