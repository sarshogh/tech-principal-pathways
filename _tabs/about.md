Hi, I’m Harry Sarshogh, an AWS Solutions Architect based in London, UK. Thanks for visiting my website.

Tech Principal Pathways is my platform for sharing real-world experience, structured thinking, and practical insights with the global technology community. My long-term ambition is to grow into a highly impactful Technology Principal and visionary architect, capable of designing not only scalable systems, but entire technological ecosystems that shape the future of human life.

My journey in software and cloud engineering began in 2010 as a junior developer. Early in my career, I repeatedly asked myself:
“How do world-class tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM consistently build scalable, high-quality products while so many teams struggle?”
That curiosity shaped my mindset and continues to drive my growth today.

Over the years, I have developed deep expertise in AWS cloud architecture, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), distributed systems, and cloud-native application design. My time at Thoughtworks played a critical role in strengthening my engineering discipline, architectural thinking, and system-level problem-solving capabilities.

I’m proud to have recently been promoted to AWS Solutions Architect in London, UK, where I focus on designing secure, scalable, and resilient architectures that support modern digital platforms and business transformation.

Looking ahead, I plan to heavily invest in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems, robotics, and human-machine collaboration. My goal is to build a broader mental model of how AI, robotics, infrastructure, ethics, and society intersect. I’m particularly inspired by the idea of a future “city of robots and humans” — a structured, harmonious environment where intelligent machines and people coexist, collaborate, and evolve together in a safe, ethical, and meaningful way.

This website serves as a growing knowledge hub where I document:

Practical AWS and cloud architecture patterns

Career pathways for engineers aiming toward senior and principal roles

My insights on AI, robotics, and emerging technologies

Reflections on technical books, systems thinking, and leadership

Lessons learned from real-world cloud and platform engineering projects

My hope is that by openly sharing my experience, thinking, and experiments, I can help other engineers accelerate their careers while contributing to a more thoughtful, human-centered technological future.
