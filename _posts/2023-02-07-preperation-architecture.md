Recently, I was promoted to a Cloud Architect role. Before my first day, I found it surprisingly hard to clearly define what my new responsibilities would be. Starting a career as a technology architect can be a confusing journey, especially when you are beginning in a completely new workplace.

Because of this, I decided to do some research, read a few books, and learn from other people’s experiences in this role.

I’d like to start a series of articles about how I prepared myself during the week before starting my new job.

One thing that naturally comes to my mind is the “big picture” of what a Technology Architect looks like — someone who is competent in both AWS cloud infrastructure and AWS cloud-native application architecture. Then I think about what pieces of that puzzle I need to find, learn, and understand within the limited time and effort I can invest.

Luckily, based on the TEDx Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY"> “The First 20 Hours — How to Learn Anything” by Josh Kaufman </a>, I realized that I can build this big picture by spending just two or three days reading as much as I can and teaching myself with whatever resources are available to me. This helps me shape a clearer understanding of the architect role and set realistic boundaries for my preparation.
