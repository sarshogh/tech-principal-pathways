After spending the past five years working in hybrid cloud architecture, mainly on AWS, I’ve realized that this field is not just about technology — it’s about clarity, balance, and continuous learning. These years have shaped how I think, design, communicate, and lead. Here are some of the most important lessons I’ve learned along the way:

- IT is a complex environment, and simplifying it for others is an art. The best architects don’t showcase complexity — they remove it.

- Context matters most. There is no “one-size-fits-all” solution; what works for one organization may fail for another.

- Before we run, we need to walk. Strong foundations always come before advanced designs.

- You can’t make an omelet without breaking some eggs. Mistakes and failures are a natural (and necessary) part of growth.

- Evolutionary architecture works; revolutionary architecture often fails. Sustainable change happens in steps, not sudden leaps.

- Scalability affects every design. A system that works today might not work tomorrow without planning for growth.

- Strong engineers often become the best architects. Hands-on experience builds better decision-makers.

- Action speaks louder than words. Real impact comes from implementation, not just ideas.

- Skills beat information. Knowing something isn’t enough — being able to use it effectively is what counts.

- Storytelling is key. How we communicate ideas can be as important as the ideas themselves.

- Build the right thing, and build it right. Choosing the correct problem is just as important as solving it well.

- Focus is currency. In a world full of distractions, attention is a superpower.

- Knowing can be the enemy of learning. Curiosity keep us moving forward.

- Most failures trace back to three things: communication, observation, and behavior.

These principles weren’t learned from books alone — they were earned through real projects, difficult decisions, failed experiments, and successful outcomes. They continue to guide how I approach architecture today and how I hope to contribute in the future.

During my recent engagements at ThoughtWorks, Brevan Howard Capital Market/Coremont, and Centrica Energy Trading, I explored hybrid infrastructure from multiple perspectives. I proactively worked to understand what success meant for each user, optimized platform costs, and built solutions with scalability in mind.

One key insight I gained is that business strategy drives IT/digital strategy. In turn, IT strategy becomes the foundation for platform strategy, which then shapes cloud strategy. Strategy acts like a force behind subsequent decision.

As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghohpe/?originalSubdomain=sg"> Gregor Hohpe, author of The Architecture Elevator,</a> points out: the economy of speed is based on the economy of scale. Amazon spent billions to become the world’s number one cloud provider, and this investment in scale enabled them to move faster and more efficiently than anyone else.

Hybrid cloud architecture is challenging, exciting, and constantly evolving. Over the past five years, I’ve learned that success comes from balancing technical excellence with context, communication, and continuous learning.
