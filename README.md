# The Tech Principle

Hi there,

I am Harry Sarshogh, and this is my personal blog where I keep my notes, share my knowledge as a computer engineer to world.

So Welcome to my page :)

Let me give you a little bit context what's in here:

In software world, there are a lot to understand, learn, study and practice. Loads of trial and errors, jigsaw puzzles to digest and solve! and frankly it's not easy!

I did a lot of study during 2020 and 2021 around almost all the aspect of IT and software world! 
from  a languages, tool, teams, patterns, industry best practices, users, cost, cloud, agile, TDD, ...... 

What came to my brain was, why there is no solid/categorsised reference over internet where anyone can quickly find out 
 - What are the basics and fundations you need to know as a software consultant !
 - What skills and competencies you should be capable of !
 - What are the scopes and areas your knowlege needed    


> I think you got the idea! right ?


## Unique big picutre
Let's be clear What I would like to offer here, it's a unique big picutre first which every software engineer with any level of knoweldge can digest it easily. 

Then narrative look to each peice of this big picture where you can : 
 - understand the basics, fundumentals
 - understand why behind the how each 
 - undersand when and what activity to do 
 - understand the different road map to grow your capabilities
 - learn and practice
    -  scope and boundry 
    -  pattern and industry best practices
 - what tools and techniques 
 - what patterns and frameworks
 - what methods and how to use them
